This is a patch for Paypal 2.0.0 gem to correct a problem with
'invoice' and 'custom' methods.

Also adds pending_reason, reason_code, memo, payment_type and exchange_rate methods.

Apply at your own gems library directory. For me it is
/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/paypal-2.0.0/

Do something like

patch -p1 < paypal.2.0.0.patch
